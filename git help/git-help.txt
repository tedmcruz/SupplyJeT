-------------------To work on Javascript with local files in locally created server-------------------------------------------------

    To allow fetch() to work on javescript with local files, you have to run : "npm install -g http-server" , this will allow you to install a local server to allow fetch. 
        Then simply run http-server in any of your project directories:
            d:\my_project> http-server
            
            or

            http-server "d:\my_project"
            http-server "C:\Users\Ted Cruz\Desktop\SupplyJeT"

        Use "CONTROL" or "CTRL" + "C" to exit servers.

-----------------Install React JS----------------------------------

    Inside the main proyect folder, enter following commands:

    REACT JS

        To install react-js :     
        
            npm install -g create-react-app

        To create app in react :

            create-react-app [name-of-app]   or   npx create-react-app [name-of-app] (this command adds dependencies from the start)

        If previous steps don't work, try this:    

            To update tar (because to fix dependencies error needed for React JS):    

                    npm install -g tar@latest
                    npm install tar@6 -g

            If previous command don't work try ignoring the error with:

                npm i tar

            Alternatively you can follow these steps: First, install npm using the command:

                sudo apt install npm

            Then download the required dependencies: 

                npx create-react-app [name-of-app]

            Then use the following command to run the application. Error has been fixed.

                cd [name-of-app]
                npm start


        Starts the development server.:
            
            cd [name-of-app]

            npm start

        Bundles the app into static files for production and starts the test runner.
        
            npm run build

        [DO NOT USE] Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!
            
            npm run eject

----------------------------Moving between directories inside command-line (cmd) (change directory)-------------------------------

    To point to folder in cmd use "/" instead of "\".
    
    To travel to directory with "spaces" in between word you have to surround forlder with quotations = "folder"

        C:/Users/"Ted Cruz"/Desktop/SupplyJeT/   or   cd C:/Users/"Ted Cruz"/Desktop/SupplyJeT/

    To navigate up directory level use:

        cd ~(here add root)

---------------------------Add Polyfill for backward compatability------------------------

    Polyfill adds backward compatibility for older browsers to be able to view our content.

        npm install --save core-js@3.25.3

--------------------------Add React-JS routing dependencies ------------------------------

    Use "npm install react-router-dom" to add dependencies of React-JS to manage routing within a proyect.

--------------------------Terminal------------------------------------

    Add "cd" befor the route to the path which will be opened, to change directory (remember to replace "/" with "\")
    
        Example 1: navigating around in the terminal
            Once you opened up your terminal, type in the following after the $ or > sign and hit enter: ($ or > is the prompt, you don’t have to retype that in the terminal, only the characters that come after them):

            $ pwd
            What do you think happened there? In your own words, try to explain what this command does.

            pwd or print working directory
            The pwd command prints out the current directory you are in. What are directories? Directories are folders, these terms are used interchangeably. If you just opened up your terminal, you are probably in the home directory of your computer, and should get an output similar to this:

            /Users/your-username
            Now that you know how to tell where you are in your computer, you might ask yourself: how I do know which files are in a directory? That’s where the ls command comes in handy.

            ls or list
            In your terminal type:

            $ ls
            and hit enter. Most likely this command returned you a bunch of files and folders. The ls command prints out the contents of a directory. If you are in the home directory of your computer you should see directories printed out such as Documents, Applications, etc. Now, how do you move across directories?

            cd or change directory
            The cd command allows you to move between directories. The cd command takes an argument, usually the name of the folder you want to move to, so the full command is cd your-directory.

            In the terminal, type:

            $ ls
            Let’s say we wanted to move to the Desktop folder: just type in your terminal

            $ cd Desktop
            Now type:

            $ pwd
            This should return you something like:

            /Users/your-username/Desktop
            Now that we moved to your Desktop, you can type ls again, then cd into it. We have just changed into a new directory. You can use these two commands to navigate around your computer.

            This is all good so far, but sometimes you might want to go deeper than one level in one command. cd allows you to do this by chaining the directories with a /, so cd your-directory becomes cd your-directory/directory-inside-your-directory.

            We now know how to move forward. But how to go back up the directory tree? Type in your terminal:

            $ cd ..
            Now do a pwd. You just went back one directory! Chaining works backwards too, so if you type cd ../.. you should be taken back two directories.

            If you want to go back to the home directory of your computer, simply type cd into the terminal. cd without an argument takes you back to the home directory regardless of where you are currently in the directory structure

            Exercise 1: use ls and cd to move in and out of a few directories on your computer
            These are the basics of navigating around in the terminal. What else would we want to do in there? How about creating directories and files?

        Example 2: creating directories and files
            mkdir or make directory
            Go back to the home directory of your computer, and type:

            $ cd
            $ mkdir temp
            into the terminal. Now use ls to see the contents of the home directory. You should see a new folder, temp there. You just created a new folder! As its name suggests, mkdir creates directories. What if we wanted to create a directory inside a directory? cd into temp and type:

            $ mkdir -p stuff/bits
            Now do an ls and you should see the stuff folder. Now run cd stuff and do another ls. Inside stuff, the bits directory was created.

            What if you wanted to create files?

            touch or create files
            Inside the bits folder, type:

            $ touch bobs.txt
            Do an ls to check whether the file has been created. Inside bits, there should be a new file called bobs.txt. We used touch to create files. With touch you can create files with any extension, just don’t forget to specify what kind of file you are creating: for example, index.html, script.js, style.css are all valid extensions.

            mv or move item
            What if you created a file in the wrong place? There’s a command for that. Let’s move bobs.txt to somewhere new. Inside the bits folder type:

            $ mv bobs.txt ..
            Type ls and the file is no longer there. Type cd .., this moves you one folder up to the stuff folder. Then type ls and the bobs.txt file will be there. There are 3 parts to this command, the mv command, the item to be moved, here it’s bobs.txt, and the new destination for the item, here we have it as .. or one directory up the structure. You could also type the destination directory, replacing the .. with stuff and it would do the same job.

            Exercise 2: cd back into temp and create a couple of new folders with files in them
            Bonus: if you are on a Mac, type this into your terminal:
            $ say hello

--------------------------How to run Javascript files in terminal------------------------------------
    
    - Have Node.js installed
    - Change route to folder containing .js file
    - Remember to use "consele.log" so that the executed .js can show results in terminal
    - run code = "node [filename.extension]"

---------------------------How To Change Git Remote Origin--------------------------------------------
    written by Schkn

    As a developer, you are probably pushing your code to your remote origin every day.

    Git is a decentralized versioning system : even if you make changes locally, you have to push them to the central repository on a regular basis.

    However, in some cases, you might choose to migrate your Git repository or to merge existing ones.

    As a consequence, you may need to change the Git origin remote to a new URL.

    In this tutorial, you are going to learn how you can change the URL of a Git remote easily.

    Getting Git Remote URL on GitHub
    Conclusion
    Change Git Remote URL
    In order to change the URL of a Git remote, you have to use the “git remote set-url” command and specify the name of the remote as well as the new remote URL to be changed.

    $ git remote set-url <remote_name> <remote_url>
    For example, let’s say that you want to change the URL of your Git origin remote.

    In order to achieve that, you would use the “set-url” command on the “origin” remote and you would specify the new URL.

    $ git remote set-url origin https://git-repo/new-repository.git
    git change remote using set url
    Congratulations, you successfully changed the URL of your Git remote!

    In order to verify that the changes were made, you can use the “git remote” command with the “-v” option (for verbose)

    $ git remote -v
    list remote using git remote
    Changing Git Remote to SSH
    In some cases, you may have configured your Git repository to use SSH key-based authentication.

    If you want to change your Git origin remote using SSH authentication, you can use the same “git remote set-url” command but you will have to use the SSH URL in order to connect.

    $ git remote set-url <remote_name> <ssh_remote_url>
    The SSH URL usually takes the following form :

    SSH URL : git@<repo_url>:<url>/<git_repository>.git
    For example, if your repository was configured on Github, you would use the following command to change your remote.

    $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repository.git
    change remote url to ssh repository
    If you are having trouble identifying the URL of your Git remote on Github, the next section might be helpful.

    Getting Git Remote URL on GitHub
    If you need to quickly find the URL of your Git remote on Github, you first need to select your repository by navigating to your repository list.

    > https://github.com/<user>/repositories
    repository list on github
    Under your repository list, select the repository you are interested in.

    Now that your repository is select, locate the “Clone or Download” option on the right-corner of your screen.

    Note : looking to learn how you can easily clone a Git repository? We got a complete guide written for you!

    When clicking on it, you should be presented with the URL of your Git repository.

    clone repository on github
    You can now use the “git remote set-url” command in order to set your Git remote URL properly (using the previous section).

    Conclusion
    In this tutorial, you learnt how you can easily change your Git remote URL (commonly named origin) by using the “git remote set-url” command.

    You also learnt that you can change it using a password protected SSH address.

    If you are looking for an easy way to generate SSH keys for Git, you should take a look at our tutorial.

    SSH key authorization is preferred over password authentication, if you have a repository with a large activity.
